  <h1>AI Video Works</h1>
  <br>
  <p><b>barefoot labyrinth (soft relax media, 2025) - </b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rajqi1R49I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> | <a href="https://john-see.vids.io/videos/ea91d4bb1b11efcb63/barefoot-labyrinth-final-comp-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full movie</a> - with this feature, I used a variety of AI video tools including QwenAI, Hunyuan, and Wan2.2. I also prompted DeepSeek to create the monologues, and used Edge TTS for text-to-speech voice generation. My intention was to create a body horror sci-fi documentary that focused primarily on female feet in a fetishistic context, while subverting audience expectations. Note: mildly not safe for work, though the work exists in an artistic context.</p>

<p><b>breath of knees (soft relax media, 2025) - </b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td3PVJwqpk8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSxSNpArMVA&t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full movie</a> - with this feature, I used Hunyuan, Hailou, and Qwen to create a multi-faceted narrative. I used Yuewen for all animal and cartoon-like imagery. My intention was to create a found footage documentary that floated between dream-logic and reality and acted as a commentary on belief, life, and death.</p>
<br>
<p><b>torment of the witch (cinema epoch, 2025)</b> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHmaqzgz1S8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> - I used DeepSeek to write code for SuperCollider, an audio synthesis and generation application. I then further produced the output to match my intended aesthetic.
   <br>
<p><b>infat***ed dot ai</b> - nsfw ai companion site</a> - I created 90% of the characters here, writing their bios, crafting their appearance, and building their image ensuring their configurations were unique and on-brand, as well as generating their images and their welcome videos and avatar videos. I have also tested various parts of the site's "Create" tool that allows users to create their own AI companions.</p>

  <p><a href="https://vvv.so/pink-witch-lickers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pink witch lickers (nft)</a> - an nft collection using midjourney that focuses on the chaos of beauty and the ritualization of vapid consumption.</p>

<p>Thank you for reviewing my work. I believe we can use AI tools to enhance our art, to create new forms and visions of art, and to express ourselves in ways that are only bound by our imagination. Let's collaborate. Thank you.</p>
