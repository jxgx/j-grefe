  <h1>Life-Making: Consultations for Creative Growth Strategies</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I am currently accepting new clients for one-on-one life-coaching sessions via phone. Please email directly if interested in receiving further details. Sessions typically run a "therapist's hour." Each session is tailored to the client's individual needs and purposes, which is communicated prior to the first session. Each individual session is billed at an flat-rate (paid in advance or prior to the following session).</p>

  <p>My experience as a life coach began in Japan where I worked as a consultant for a large educational corporation in Tokyo giving workshops to international educators on how to develop rapport and practice communicative competency techniques to help them exist more cohesively within Japanese professional communities. As a student of Constructive Living, I met Dr. David K. Reynolds in Japan in 2005 and have been a student and practicioner of CL ever since. In 2010, I relocated to China. With his blessings, I taught leadership and various "life-making" essays written by Dr. Lee Thayer to advanced students at the prestigious Tsinghua International School Attached to Tsinghua University in Beijing. I earned my M.F.A. in Creative Writing in 2016 and developed a unique way of expressing the self through the use of both traditional narrative forms as well as "hybrid essays," which synthesized lyric essays, fragemented poetics, and life narratives. In 2016, I earned my NLP Practioner & NLP Master Practioner Certification as well as a Life Coach Certification. My current creative and psycho-energetic work involves yoga, butoh, breathwork, bodywork, inner guidance meditations, and developing one's creativity across disciplines.</p>
