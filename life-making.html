  <h1>Consultant for Creative Growth Strategies</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I am currently accepting new students for one-on-one life growth sessions via phone. Please email directly if interested in receiving further details. Sessions typically run a "therapist's hour." Each session is tailored to the studient's individual needs and purposes, which is communicated prior to the first session. Each individual session is billed at an flat-rate (paid in advance or prior to the following session).</p> 
  <p>My experience in life-growth strategy began in Japan in 2004. At that time, I operated as a full-time Communication Consultant for an educational corporation in Tokyo. My role included teaching and contributing to workshops for international educators, as well as consulting in the classroom, and curriculum development. In 2005, I met with Dr. David K. Reynolds, founder of Constructive Living, and have continued working with CL methodologies ever since. In 2010, I relocated to China. I taught leadership and various "life-making" ideas as written by Dr. Lee Thayer to advanced students at the prestigious Tsinghua International School Attached to Tsinghua University in Beijing. I also taught classes on Creativity and Literature Analysis. I earned my M.F.A. in Creative Writing in 2016 from New England College and developed a unique way of expressing the self through the use of both traditional narrative forms as well as "hybrid essays," which synthesized essay writing, fragemented poetics, and life narratives. In 2016, I earned my NLP Practioner & NLP Master Practioner Certification as well as a Life Coach Certification. My current creative and psycho-energetic work involves Hot Yoga, Butoh dance, breathwork, bodywork, Divine Science, and developing one's creativity across disciplines. I also regularly write, direct, and produce feature films for the international market.</p>
