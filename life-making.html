  <h1>Life-Making: Consultations for Creative Growth Strategies</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I am currently accepting new clients for private phone-based coaching sessions. Please email if interested in receiving further details. Sessions typtically run a "therapist's hour." Each session is tailored to the client's individual needs and purposes. Sessions vary between weekly and bi-weekly (depending on availability) and each session is billed at an individual flat-rate (paid in advance or prior to the following session).</p>
