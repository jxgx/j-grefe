<p>In early 2022 I began work on a slimy novella heavily inspired by the classic tentacle-laden masterpiece of cinema known as GUZOO: THE THING FORSAKEN BY GOD. I wrote close to 20K words, but the project eventually fell flat from inattention. It's difficult for me to put aside a project and let it simmer. I tend to work best in situations that involve striking effectively (and quickly) with sustained effort followed by careful revision. In the meantime, I had been doing a lot of screenwriting and, from June, learned basic Python programming and took a course to review Computer Science fundamentals. I revisited the novella project in October 2022 and found I had lost the thread and the will to continue the work. However, I did feel the need to slice the project into a new form, to extract a juicy fragment that could hopefully capture the story's initial spirit. And I found that precise fragment and breathed life into it. And it now lives. Please read the "micro-novel" (a poem, at heart) of <a href="https://jamie-grefe.com/paroxysms.html">GUZOO: THE THING FORSAKEN BY GOD</a>. And Happy 2023. Keep "doing the Now well" and may you live the life you aspire to live.</p>
