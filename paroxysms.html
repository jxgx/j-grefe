  <h2>BEFORE THE FALL, SHUN THE VOID</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Approaching the stairs and gripping the ground. Crawling through a trail of grass, of slime. Look up. Surrounded by light prickles, by the mumbles of the dead. Claw up. Nails claw cement steps. Tear into skin. Grip. Pull. Wrench the body higher. 
<br>
Approaching the stairs and gripping the ground. The desert dirt browns as the sun sets. The sun sets on your life. And you're forced to spin and rush to the one that still feels right as the mind skitters away Love, shuns empty grace. Reach and slam down fists on concrete. Shatter the concrete into words and hurl the bits to the black. Are your eyes focused on the black beyond? Or have the wisps in the mist blinded you to the light beyond death? 
<br>
Approaching the stairs and gripping the ground. The dirt of your lies has been swept clean, stripped to nothing but pure light and inward flow. Tear and Pull. Grip and wrench at the ground. Sludge yourself to the holy vault. Pray the body back to life. Let the mind forget the fall when the fingers lose grip and let go.</p>

<h2>PALMS OPEN TO THE SUN IN PRAYER</h2>
  <br>
<p>She unwraps the gift and is suddenly blinded, veins split to the open void that now rushed toward her like a swallowing wind. A fleshy circular opening had born itself into the root of her right palm. A wavering cluster of threads and muscle that yearned to tear itself to sinewy strands. Sophie beheld her hand. She tried to conjure from the void-song, but couldn't. Instead, she was enchanted by the openings' visual conflict. Moments later she'd remember the old lady with the oaken cane, the stallion with the emerald eyeball, and the clown on North Stratmore. But those revelations would have to wait. The wound pulsated, filled with a radiant orange heat. So she held herself up to the sun and presented her palm to the outer light of space itself. Sophie shut her eyes, remembered the walk from the driveway up the steps and into the house. Especially on cold snowy days. She'd remember this so intensely, that by the time the sun burned itself into the slit of her face, her melted skin would already be trails of vapor and flame and smoke rising to heaven.</p>
